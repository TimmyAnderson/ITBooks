# ITBooks

The repository contains all source codes I created when studying the following IT books. Please note, these sources codes are my own work. There are not just downloaded codes from books' web pages but my own samples based on the topics I learnt from these books.
All comments and remarks (remarks are in files like !!!.txt or so) are written in my native language Slovak.
